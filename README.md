Remove Background WebGPU
---

This is a simple web application that uses WebGPU to remove the background from an image. It uses the `transformers.js` library to load a pre-trained model and run inference on the image.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js-examples/blob/main/remove-background-webgpu
